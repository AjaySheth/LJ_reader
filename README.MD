# LJ Reader: LabJack T7 Analog Input Testing Framework

This repository contains Python scripts for testing and monitoring analog inputs on a LabJack T7 device with a MUX80 multiplexer and CB37 terminal block adapters. Below is a description of each script in the repository.

## Folder Contents

### Python Scripts

#### `mux_read.py`
The main script for reading and displaying live voltage data from all analog input (AIN) channels. It uses a graphical interface (bar chart) to show real-time voltage readings for up to 120 channels when using the MUX80 expansion board.

#### `lj_init.py`
A simple script to initialize a LabJack device and read its serial number. Useful for verifying the connection to the device.

#### `dual_ain_loop.py`
Demonstrates how to read two analog inputs (AIN0 and AIN1) in a loop. Includes configuration for different LabJack devices (T4, T7, T8) and provides example usage of the LabJack LJM library.

#### `lj_read.py`
Reads analog inputs AIN0 and AIN1 from a LabJack T7 device and plots their absolute values in real time. Also calculates and plots the difference between the two inputs.

#### `lj_temp.py`
Reads voltage data from AIN0 and AIN1, calculates the temperature using a Chebyshev polynomial, and plots both the voltage and temperature in real time. Data is also logged to CSV files (`time_voltage.csv` and `time_temp.csv`).

#### `temp_calc.py`
A standalone script for testing the Chebyshev polynomial used to convert voltage to temperature. Prompts the user for a voltage value and outputs the corresponding temperature.

#### `lj_plotter.py`
A generic CSV plotter that reads data from a CSV file and plots it based on user-selected columns. Useful for visualizing logged data from other scripts.

#### `lj_log.py`
Monitors and logs real-time voltage readings from AIN0 and AIN1, along with their difference. Displays the data in a live plot and trims old data to maintain a fixed time window.

### Other Files

#### `docs/`
Contains documentation and reference materials:
- `Appendix C - AIN Registers.pdf`: Details about AIN registers for LabJack devices.
- `Mux80 AIN Expansion Board Datasheet.pdf`: Datasheet for the MUX80 expansion board.
- `MUX80_pinout.png`: Pinout diagram for MUX80.

#### `run_1/`
Contains example output files from `lj_temp.py`:
- `LabJack_T7_Real-Time_Voltage_and_Temperature_Monitor.png`: A screenshot of the real-time monitor.
- `time_temp.csv` and `time_voltage.csv`: Example CSV files generated by `lj_temp.py`.

## Prerequisites

- **LabJack LJM Library**: Ensure the LabJack LJM Library is installed on your system. You can download it from the [LabJack website](https://labjack.com/support/software/installers).
- **Python 3.7 or later**: Make sure Python is installed along with the required libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `labjack`, `pandas`).

## Usage

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib labjack pandas
